## Project description
A React application that allows user to retrieve data from a form and then passes that data to a list.
The data can be sorted depending on the filter user clicked.

### Features
* Add Users: Users can be added with a username, email, and type (admin or user). Each user is assigned a unique ID at the time of creation.
* Filter Users: The application allows filtering of the list to show only admins, only users, or all users.
* Dynamic List Visibility: The users list is only visible when there are users present. It disappears when the list is empty.
